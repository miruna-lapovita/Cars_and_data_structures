Hellow traveller!

Here you can see one of my first projects in python, one that works on a list of car models.
It's pretty simple, but a good way to study and exercise merge sort, bubble sort, binary search and secvential sort.
It works pretty intuitively, you just have these two options, but with there's also the functinality where you can compare how long each 
process takes to finish and understand efficiency.

Have a nice day <3
